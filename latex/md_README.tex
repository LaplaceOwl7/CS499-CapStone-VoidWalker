CS300 for SNHU. \begin{DoxyVerb}[What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?]
\end{DoxyVerb}
 This course’s tasks revolved around designing and implementing standard practices of algorithms in our courses. We were tasked with implementing data structures like Hash tables, vectors, binary search trees, and various sorting functions. \begin{DoxyVerb}How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
\end{DoxyVerb}
 My approach to problems is methodical and contemplative. This course required us to plan our code with pseudocode before beginning the actual development. Data structures are an important topic for storing, indexing, and navigating the ever-\/increasing plethora of data. With the rapidly changing environment, data storage has been steadily increasing for years. Any prospective software developer needs to be familiar with the most common methods of storing. \begin{DoxyVerb}How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
\end{DoxyVerb}
 The primary solution was to step back and consult other resources. The best way to learn is to watch master’s and try to replicate it. Thankfully, these data structures have no shortage of helpful resources to understand the operations. \begin{DoxyVerb}How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
\end{DoxyVerb}
 These courses provided a great opportunity to increase coding comfort but also required us to increase our skills in writing pseudocode and designing the code before typing it out. The algorithms themselves were challenging despite their simplicity. These courses broadened my understanding of how data is accessed and parsed. \begin{DoxyVerb}How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
\end{DoxyVerb}
 The course constantly reminded me to keep my functions modular, comment heavily, and ensure errors could be handled. Some of the timetables and rigid requirements narrowed down the creativity but provided more real-\/life scenarios where most of the desired functionality has been decided by the customer.
